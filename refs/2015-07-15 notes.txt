OPTIMIZATION

out of order and in parallel


An instruction, along with its required data operands, is transmitted to an execution unit as a packet, also called an instruction token. Similarly, output data is transmitted back to the CAM as a data token. The packetization of instructions and results allows for parallel execution of ready instructions on a large scale.

FRP: Discrete
Formulations such as Event-Driven FRP and Elm require that updates are discrete and event-driven.[3] These formulations have pushed for practical FRP, focusing on semantics that have a simple API that can be implemented efficiently in a setting such as robotics or in a web-browser.[4]

In these formulations, it is common that the ideas of behaviors and events are combined into signals that always have a current value, but change discretely.[5]

An HDL module is written to provide the circuit stimulus.  This is known as a testbench
