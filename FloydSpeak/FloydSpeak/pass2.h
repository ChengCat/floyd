/*
	Pass2: Semantic pass - resolve types, resolve variables, generate compiler error.

	- Generate compiler errors.
	- Verifies all expression and statement semantics
	- Resolves types and track them explicitly.
	- Checks that all types are compatible.
	- Resolves variable accesses (when possible).
	- Assign a result-type to each expression.


	OUTPUT FORMAT GOALS
	- Easy to read for humans
	- Easy to transform
	- Lose no information -- keep all original names and comments.
	- Not simplified or optimized in any way.


	TODO
	- Use *index* of member, not the name.
	- Check input as if user input -- allows pass2 to be run on external JSON of AST.
