# BASIC TYPES
- **float32**				32 bit floating point
- **float80**				80 bit floating point
- **int8**					8 bit integer
- **int16**
- **int32**
- **int64**
- **function**				function pointer. Functions can be Floyd functions or C functions.


### MORE TYPES

- **dict**			look up values from a key. Localizable.
- **vector**		look up values from a 0-based continous range of integer indexes.
- **enum**		same as struct with only static constant data members

# CORE TYPE FEATURES
These are features built into every type: integer, string, struct, collections etc.

- **hash hash(v)**							computes a true-deep hash of the value



# PROOF & ASSERT
Floyd has serveral built in features to check code correctness. One of the core features is assert() which is a function that makes sure an expression is true or the program will be stopped. If the expression is false, the program is defect.

This is used through out this document to demonstrate language features.


# VALUES, VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS

- Global variables
- Contents of collections


Use _mutable_ to define a local variable that can be mutated. Only _local variables_ can be mutable.

	int hello2(){
		mutable a = "hello";
		a = "goodbye";	//	Changes variable a to "goodbye".
		return 3;
	}



# IF - THEN -ELSE -- STATEMENT & EXPRESSION
This is a normal if-else-if-else construct, like in most languages.

		if(s == "one"){
			return 1;
		}
		else if(s == "two"){
			return 2;
		}
		else{
			return -1;
		}

In each body you can write any statements. There is no "break" keyword. { and }Â are required.

??? Replace with expression:

		int val = if(s == "one"){
			return 1;
		}
		else if(s == "two"){
			return 2;
		}
		else{
			return -1;
		}




# MORE EXPRESSIONS
	!a

### Bitwise Operators
!a					inverts a bool: true becomes false, false becomes true.
~a
^a


# LOOPS AND CONDITIONS
The foreach uses the seq-protocol to process all items in a seq, one by one.

foreach(a in stuff){
}
foreach(thing, [string]{ 1, 2, 3 })

switch() -- has modern update, no default or break. ??? todo

	for(int i = 0 ; i < 100 ; i++){
	}

while(expression){
}




# ENUM
Works like expected from C, but can be extended.

enum preset_colo {
	red = 2,
	green,
	blue
}

enum preset_color_ex : preset color {
	yellow,
}


# ABOUT COLLECTIONS
A fixed set of collections are built right into Floyd. They can store any Floyd value, including structs, tuples, string, integers and even other collections. They are all immutable / persistent.

A unique feature in Floyd is that you cannot specify the exact implementation of the collection, only its basic type: vector or dictionary. The precise data structure is selected by the runtime according to your recommendations and the optimiser / profiler.

The collections are typesafe - a string-vector can only hold strings etc.

Every collection automatically support the core-type-features, like comparisons, serialization and hashing.


# VECTOR COLLECTION
A vector is a collection where you lookup your values using an index between 0 and (vector_size - 1). The elements are ordered. Finding the correct element is constant-time.

If you read many continous elements it's faster to use a SEQ with the vector - it allows the runtime to keep an pointer to the current position in the vector.

	a = [int]();					//	Create empty vector of ints.
	b = [int](1, 2, 3);				//	Create a vector with three ints.
	b = [1, 2, 3];					//	Shortcut to create a vector with three ints. Int-type is deducted from value.
	a = [string]();					//	Empty vector of strings
	b = [string] ( "a", "b", "c");	//	Vector initialized to 3 strings.
	b = ["one", "two", "three"];	//	Shortcut to create a vector with 3 strings.

The vector is persistent so you can write elements to it, but you always get a new vector back - the original vector is unmodified:

	a = ["one", "two", "three" ];
	b = a[1] = "zwei";
	assert(a == ["one", "two", "three" ] && b == ["one", "zeei", "three" ]);

The runtime has several types of backends for a vector and choses for each vector *instances* - not each type:

1. A C-array. Very fast to make and read, very compact. Slow and expensive to mutate (requires copying the entire array).
2. A HAMT-based persistent vector. Medium-fast to make, read and write. Uses more memory.
3. A function. Compact, potentially very fast / very slow. No write.

Vector Reference:

	a = [T][ 1, 2, 3, ... ];
	a = [T](seq<T> in);
	int a.count()
	a = b + c;	//	append
	vector<T> subset(vector<T> in, int start, int end);

Future: find, filter, map, fold, sort


# DICTIONARY COLLECTION
A collection that maps a key to a value. Unsorted. Like a c++ map. 
	//	Create a string -> int dictionary with three entries.
	a = [string: int]["red": 0, "blue": 100,"green": 255];

	//	Make dictionary where key is a string and value is an int. Initialize it.
	a = [string: int]("one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3);

	//	Make a string->int dictionary where collection type is deducted from the initialization values.
	b = ["one": 1, "two": 2, "three", 3];

	c = [string: int]; //	Empty dictionary of string,int.
	

Dictionary Reference

	V my_dict.at(K key)
	V my_dict[K key]
	my_dict[K key] = value
	bool my_dict.empty()
	size_t my_dict.size()
	dict<K, V> my_dict.insert(K key, V value)
	size_t my_dict.count()
	dict<K, V> my_dict.erase(K key)



# AST
The encoding of a Floyd program into a AST (abstrac syntax tree) is fully documented. You can generate, manipulate and run these programs from within your own program.s

The tree is stored as standard JSON data. Each expression is a JSON-array where elements have defined meaning. You can nest expressions to any depth by specifying an expression instead of a constant.

### STATEMENTS

	[ "bind", identifier-string, expr ]
	[ "defstruct", identifier-string, expr ]
	[ "deffunc", identifier-string, expr ]
	[ "return", expr ]


### EXPRESSIONS
This is how all expressions are encoded into JSON format. "expr" is a placehold for another expression array. 
[ "k", expr, type ]

[ "negate", expr, type ]

[ "+", left_expr, right_expr, type ]
[ "-", left_expr, right_expr, type ]
[ "*", left_expr, right_expr, type ]

# More STRUCT features --- TODO NEXT

**??? Unify adressing nested dictionaries with structs and vectors. Functions too. Equivalent dict.member like dict["member"].**



# STRUCTs - Operator overloading --- TODO NEXT
This is useful for vector2d, mystring etc. You may need operator overloading for simple structs too -- feature not tied to advance structs.

- rect operator+(rect a, rect b) = default
- rect operator-(rect a, rect b) = default
- rect operator*(rect a, rect b) = default
- rect operator/(rect a, rect b) = default
- rect operator%(rect a, rect b) = default

- bool operator<(rect a, rect b) = default

- bool operator<=(rect a, rect b) -- if not implemented, Floyd uses: !operator<(b, c)
- bool operator==(rect a, rect b) -- if not implemented, Floyd uses: !(operator<(a, b) || operator(b, a))

#### Not overloadable, automatically use core equality functions
- bool operator>(rect a, rect b) --- compiler replaces this with !operator<=()
- bool operator>=(rect a, rect b) --- compiler replaces this with !operator<()
- bool operator!=(rect a, rect b) --- compiler replaces this with !operator==()


# Advanced STRUCTs --- TODO NEXT

**??? Maybe this isn't a struct but a class? Or something else? **

There is a second, more advanced flavor of struct where the struct has an invariant that needs protecting. It is quick to upgrade a simple struct to the advanced variant and no clients needs to be affected.

An invariant is a dependency between the member variables that must always be correct. Every function that modifies or creates this struct must make sure the invariant is always correct.

With an advanced struct all automatic behavior is by default turned off and you need to enable / code each explicitly.

GOAL:

- as few functions as possible have access to the internals of the invariant, including rect's implementation
- clients should not need changing if we go from simple struct to advanced
- clients should not need changing if we make a member variable part of the invariant
- clients should not need changing if a function is a altered to have access / not access to privates.

Advice: Encapsule invariant into the smallest struct possible: big structs may want to nest many structs instead of having complex invariant.

All you need to do upgrade a simple struct to an advance struct is to wrap its data in a state {}. Now all member access is blocked by clients, but you can still:
- copy
- delete
- compare

	struct rect {

		//	Internal data is wrapped in "state", which is a simple-struct.
		//	The state-struct has a init(float width, float height) and
		//	all other features of a basic struct but clients to rect cannot
		//	access.
		//	Member functions of rect can access state directly as a struct
		//	member called "state".
		state {
			float width;
			float height;
		}
	}

**??? improve state-syntax to make state a normal simple-struct that you can adress both type and member.**

The **state** is a built-in keyword and you can only have **one** state in a struct, which kicks it over into being an advanced struct. Advanced structs cannot have other member data besides its state.

It is possible to use any types inside the state, which lets just put other advanced structs inside rect.

To restore all previous functionality to make clients work as before:

	struct rect {
		//	Allow read & write of width & height. "default" is a
		//	convenience function for mapping to the state-member
		//	of the same name.
		float width: get = default, set = default
		float height: get = default, set = default
		init: default

		state {
			float width;
			float height;
		}
	}

This is what's really going on - the gets and sets use lambdas to add code to getters and setters.

	struct rect {
		float width:
			get = { return $0.state.width; },
			set = { return $0.state.width = $1; }
		float height:
			get = { return $0.state.height },
			set = { return $0.state.height = $1; }

		init(float width, float height){
			return state(width, height)
		}

		state {
			float width;
			float height;
		}
	}
**??? remove need for this.state.width. Better with this..width or this->width or this._.width**

Adding an invariant to the struct - area must always be width * height:

	//	Setters need to update area too!
	struct rect {
		float width:
			get = default,
			set = { s2 = $0.state.width = $1; s2.state.area = s2.state.width * s2.state.height; return s2; }
		float height:
			get = default,
			set = { s2 = $0.state.height = $1; s2.state.area = s2.state.width * s2.state.height; return s2; }
		float area:
			get = default

		init(float width, float height){
			return state(width, height, width * height)
		}

		state {
			float width;
			float height;
			float area;
		}
	}

You can add member functions. They can access the state directly:

	struct rect {
		float width:
			get = default,
			set = { s2 = $0.state.width = $1; s2.state.area = s2.state.width * s2.state.height; return s2; }
		float height:
			get = default,
			set = { s2 = $0.state.height = $1; s2.state.area = s2.state.width * s2.state.height; return s2; }
		float area:
			get = default

		init(float width, float height){
			return state(width, height, width * height)
		}

		state {
			float width;
			float height;
			float area;
		}

		//	Member function has access to state.
		bool is_empty(rect this){
			return this.state.area == 0
		}

		//	Can read state, create state.
		rect scale(rect this, float k){
			return state(this.state.width * k, this.state.height * k, this.state.width * k * this.state.height * k)
		}

		//	Can MUTATE state, create state.
		rect scale(rect this, float k){
			a = this.state.width = this.state.width * k
			b = a.state.height = a.state.height * k
			c = b.state.area = b.state.width * b.state.height
			return c
		}
	}

- There is no special implicit "this" argument to functions, you need to add it manually.
- It is not possible to change member variables of a value, instead you return a completely new instance of the struct.


### Unified access for member and non-members

Here are some non-member functions:

	rect make_square(float side){
		return rect(side, side)
	}

	bool is_square(rect this){
		return this.width == this.height
	}

	rect double_sides(rect this){
		return scale(this, 2)
	}

Member functions are called just like normal functions, no special -> syntax:

	a = rect(100, 100)
	assert(is_empty(a) == false)

	b = scale(rect(100, 100), 2)
	assert(b == rect(200, 200))

Accessing member variable (simple struct or advances struct):

	a = rect(4, 5)
	assert(a.width == 4)

>IDEA: Syntactic sugar for member variables:
>
>	width(a) a.width
>
>This makes it possible to implement struct getter/setter like this:**
>
>		rect {
>			float width(rect this){ return this.state.width; }
>			rect width(rect this, float width){ return this.state.width = width; }
>			...
>		}
>...and lets us remove set/get special syntax.


Syntactic sugar for member functions:

	is_empty(a) == a.is_empty()

Syntactic sugar for free functions:

	a = rect(6, 6);
	assert(is_square(a) == true)
	assert(a.is_square() == true)



# STRUCTs: paths
**??? Add paths to change deeply nested members?**
window_mgr_t m2 = window_mgr.window[3].root_view.child[0].title = "Welcome"
Add: assoc, assoc_inc, deassoc, deassoc_in. Works with path-objects.
Path object = vector of keys / indexes?

Path = is resolved everytime it is used -- it does NOT keep reference to target objects.

b = assoc_in(a, [ "window_mgr", "root_view", "child", "title"], "Welcome)

p = path(window_mgr.window[3].root_view.child[0].title)
p = &window_mgr.window[3].root_view.child[0].title
b = *p = "Welcome"


# STRUCTs: read-modify-write

**??? Idea - use special operator for assigning to struct member: "b = a.red <- 10;"**
**??? Add feature to read-modify-write value without listing path twice?**

		window_mgr_t m2 = window_mgr.window[3].root_view.child[0].title = "Welcome: " + $0

Use <- to read & modify? A generic version of C's "a += 3".
		a <= $0 + 3
		a <= { $0 + 3 }
Works like map() but for any nested variable.


# STRUCTs: Invariant function -- SOMEDAY MAYBE

Advances structs requires an invariant() function. It performs checks that the value isn't corrupt. If it fails the code is defect. The invariant function will automatically be called before a new value is exposed to client code: when returning a value from a constructor, from a mutating member function etc.

	invariant(pixel_t this){
		assert(this.red >= 0 && this.red <= 255)
	}

# STRUCTs EXAMPLES-FEATURE --- SOMEDAY MAYBE
When defining a data type (composite) you need to list 4 example instances. Can use functions to build them or just fill-in manually or a mix. These are used in example docs, example code and for unit testing this data types and *other* data types. You cannot change examples without breaking client tests higher up physical dependency graph.


# STRUCTs: Unnamed struct members (tuples)
All members also have number in the order they are listed in the struct, starting with 0. A second name for the same member.

You can chose to not name members. An unnamed member can be accessed using its position in the struct: first member is "0", second is called "1" etc. Access like: "my_pixel.0".

my_pixel[0] // allow clients to enumerate struct members as elements. If all members are the same type result is that type. If struct members are different types, result is a dyn<int, float>

**??? How to block mutation of member variable? Some members makes no sense to write in isolation.**


# STRUCTs: Unnnamed structs (tuples)
You can access the members using indexes instead of their names, for use as a tuple. Also, there is no need to name a struct.

	a = struct { int, int, string }( 4, 5, "six");
	assert(a.0 == 4);
	assert(a.1 == 5);
	assert(a.2 == "six");
	
	b = struct { 4, 5, "six" };
	assert(a.0 == 4);
	assert(a.1 == 5);
	assert(a.2 == "six");



# Functions -- alternative design:

(Int, Int) -> (Int)

??? idea: functions have ONE input and one output:

	bool f(string a, string b) --- this is a function that has (string a, string b) tuple as input, bool as output.
	(string a, string b) f(bool v)
	(string, string) f(bool v)


??? Idea: all functions can be implemented by an expression. Only use {} if you want to do local variables:

	//	Fully specified function definition.
	bool (string a, string b) f = bool(string a, string b){ return a < b; }

	//	Only need to specify function type once:
	f = bool(string a, string b){ return a < b; }
	bool (string a, string b) f = { return $0 < $1; 
	//	Special shorthand for C and Java and Javasript users.
	bool f(string a, string b){ return a < b; }

	bool f(string a, string b) = return $0 < $1;


# LAMBDAS -- FUTURE

Lambdas aka closures are unnamed function-expressions. You make a little function that can be called later, without going through the trouble of making a full blown function. Lambdas also supports accessing variables outside its definition which is very useful when you.

**??? Lambdas are pure?!**

Lambdas are often short snippets of code passed to a functions, like a compare function passed to a sort function.

Function type X:

	bool (string a, string b)

Function implementation f1 of type X

	bool f1(string a, string b){ return a < b ; }

Variable of type X

	bool (string a, string b) f2 = f1

Example sort function that takes function as argument #2.

	[string] sort([string] values, bool (string a, string b) equal)

Equivalent calls to sort function:

	s1 = sort([ "one", "two", "three" ], f1)
	s2 = sort([ "one", "two", "three" ], bool (string a, string b){ return a < b; })
	s3 = sort([ "one", "two", "three" ], (a, b){ return a < b; })

	s4 = sort([ "one", "two", "three" ], { return $0 < $1; })


s3 and s4 - the type of the function is inferred.

s4: All functions can always access their argument using $0, $1 etc. We use this here since we didn't name the function arguments.


- No trailing closure syntax
- No implicit returns from single-expression closures

You can use a lambda to do directly assign a value from an if-then-else:

	string m = (int id){
		float temp = 0
		if (a == 1){
			return "FIRST!";
		}
		else{
			return "...more";
		}
	}(1)
