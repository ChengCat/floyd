??? How to get programmers to use some features of Floyd with their current tools? 




1) Prove that you can design solid programs using boards, wires and function - with clocks. Multi threaded.

Mutability, external i/o, clocks, threads, unreliable extern objects (file in FS etc).

Runtime written in C++, interpreted boards, not compiled to LLV:
Basic toolbox for user-functions.

Some simple tweaks.


2) Optimize scedueling system, collections now persistent v1, more tweaks.

3) Low-level optimisations - LLVM








==============================

















MILESTONES


MS: Easy to make simulations and run them. JSON? Useful C++ library. Demonstrates programming model. Mutation, clocks.

MS: 
MS: Multithreaded - speed! Thread pool.

MS: Persistent collections

Clock transformers


MS: CHIPs


MS:Generate static c / C++. C ABI


Advanced scheduling, tweaks, lazy, prelacy.


UI

Exceptions

Monads
