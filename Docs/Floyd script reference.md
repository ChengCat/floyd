# Floyd Script Reference

Floyd Script is a fast and modern C-like program language that tries to make writing correct programs simpler and faster than any other programming language.

It's focus is composability, minimalism and proven programming techniques, like pure functions and immutability.

It as a unique concept to handle mutation of data, control of the outside world (files, network, UI) and controlling time.

Functions and classes are pure. A pure function can only call pure functions. Mutable data can exist locally inside a function, but never leak out of the function. 

This delegates all mutation / time to the top levels of your program. Here you need to call non-pure functions to affect the world around the program. You must tag your functions with "nonpure" to be able to call other nonpure functions.

	But programming is NOT math!

This makes those functions a risk. Have as little nonpure code as possible. Try to not have any conditional code inside nonpure code - this makes testing easier. Put all logic into the pure functions.

# COMPOSABILITY

Features that break composabiity is limited and carefully controlled in the language. Things like threading and synchronisation, error responses, file handling, optimization choices. Normal Floyd code lives free, outside of time and the real world and can be used in many contexts.

To easy composability, the basic wiring between libraries and subsystems is built-in and standardized - this like common datatypes, error propagation between libraries, logging and asserts, memory handling and streaming data. All built-in and composable.


# BASIC TYPES

These are the primitive data types built into the language itself. The goals is that all the basics you need are already there in the language. This makes it easy to start making useful programs, you don't need to chose or build the basics. It allows composability since all libraries can rely on these types and communicate bewteen themselves using them. Reduces need for custom types and glue code.

- **int**			Same as int64
- **bool**			**true** or **false**
- **string**		built-in string type. 8bit pure (supports embedded nulls).
					Use for machine strings, basic UI. Not localizable.
- **float**			32-bit floating point number

- **function**		A function value. Functions can be Floyd functions or C functions. They are callable.


# COMPOSITE TYPES

These are composites and collections of other types.
- **struct**		like C struct or class or tuple.
- **vector**		an a continous array of elements addressed via indexes.

# CORE TYPE FEATURES

These are features built into every type: integer, string, struct, collections etc.

- **a = b** 							This true-deep copies the value b to the new name a.
- **a == b**							Compares the two values, deeply.
- **a != b**							Derivated of a == b.
- **a < b**								Tests all member data in the order they appear in the struct.
- **a <= b**, **a > b**, **a >= b**	These are derivated of a < b


# TRUE DEEP

True-deep is a Floyd term that means that all values and sub-values are always considered in operations in any type of nesting of structs and values and collections. This includes equality checks or assignment, for example.

The order of the members inside the struct (or collection) is important for sorting since those are done member by member from top to bottom.


# VALUES, VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS

All "variables" aka values are immutable.

- Function arguments
- Local function variables
- Member variables of structs etc.

Floyd is statically typed, which means every variable only supports a specific type of value.

When defining a variable you can often skip telling which type it is, since the type can be deduced by the Floyd compiler.

Explicit

```
	int x = 10;
```

Implicit

```
	y = 11;
```


Example:

```
	int main(){
		a = "hello";
		a = "goodbye";	//	Runtime error - you cannot change variable a.
		return 3;
	}
```

You can use "mutable" to make a local variable changeable.

```
	int main(){
		mutable a = "hello";
		a = "goodbye";	//	Changes variable a to "goodbye".
		return 3;
	}
```

# GLOBAL SCOPE

Here you normally define functions, structs and global constants. The global scope can have almost any statement and they execute at program start, before main() is called. You don't even need a main function if you don't want it.


**main()** This function is called by the host when program starts. You get the input arguments from the outside world (command line arguments etc) and you can return an integer to the outside.


# FUNCTIONS

Functions in Floyd are by default pure, or referential transparent. This means they can only read their input arguments and constants, never read or modify anything else that can change. It's not possible to call a function that returns different values at different times, like get_time().

While a function executes, it percieves the outside world to stand still.

Functions always return exactly one value. Use a struct to return more values.

A function without return value usually makes no sense since function cannot have side effects. Possible uses would be logging, asserting or throwing exceptions.

Example function definitions:

```
	int f1(string x){
		return 3;
	}

	int f2(int a, int b){
		return 5
	}

	int f3(){	
		return 100;
	}

	string f4(string x, bool y){
		return "<" + x + ">";
	}
```

Function types:

```
	bool (string, float)
```


This is a function that takes a function value as argument:

```
	int f5(bool (string, string))
```

This is a function that returns a function value:

```
	bool (string, string) f5(int x)
```


# EXPRESSIONS

Reference: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_operators.htm
Comparisons are true-deep - they consider all members and also member structs and collections.

###	Arithmetic Operators
How to add and combine values:

```
+	Addition - adds two operands: "a = b + c", "a = b + c + d"
âˆ’	Subtracts second operand from the first. "a = b - c", "a = b - c - d"
*	Multiplies both operands: "a = b * c", "a = b * c * d"
/	Divides numerator by de-numerator: "a = b / c", "a = b / c / d"
%	Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division: "a = b / c", "a = b / c / d"
```

### Relational Operators
Used to compare two values. The result is true or false:

```
**a == b**				true if a and b have the same value
	a != b				true if a and b have different values
	a > b				true if the value of a is greater than the value of b
	a < b				true if the value of a is smaller than the value of b
	a >= b
	a <= b
```

### Logical Operators
Used to compare two values. The result is true or false:

```
	a && b
	a || b
```

### Conditional Operator
```
	condition ? a : b
```

When the condition is true, this entire expression has the value of a. Else it has the value of b. Condition, a and b can all be complex expressions, with function calls etc.

```
	bool is_polite(string x){
		return x == "hello" ? "polite" : "rude"
	}
	assert(is_polity("hiya!") == false);
	assert(is_polity("hello") == true);
```


# IF - THEN - ELSE -- STATEMENT

This is a normal if-elseif-else feature, like in most languages. Brackets are required always.

```
		if (s == "one"){
			return 1;
		}
```

You can add an else body like this:

```
		if(s == "one"){
			return 1;
		}
		else{
			return -1;
		}
```

Else-if lets you avoid big nested if-else statements and do this:

```
		if(s == "one"){
			return 1;
		}
		else if(s == "two"){
			return 2;
		}
		else{
			return -1;
		}
```

In each body you can write any statements. There is no "break" keyword.


# LOOPS: FOR AND WHILE

There are two loop feature, the for-loop and the while-loop. They are simpler and stricter than in most other languages, like the C programming language.


# FOR

For-loops are used to evaluate its body many times, with a range of input values. The entire condition expression is evaluated *before* the first time the body is called. This means the program already decided the number of loops to run before running the first time.

Closed range that starts with 1 and ends with 5.:

```
	for (index in 1...5) {
		print(index)
	}
```

Open range that starts with 1 and ends with 59:

```
	for (tickMark in 0..<60) {
	}
```

You can use expressions for range:

```
	for (tickMark in a..<string.size()) {
	}
```



Above snippet simulates the for loop of the C language but it works a little differently. There is always exactly ONE loop variable and it is defined and inited in the first section, checked in the condition section and incremented / updated in the third section. It must be the same symbol.
The result is the equivalent to

```
	b = 3
	{ a = 0; print(a + b); }
	{ a = 1; print(a + b); }
	{ a = 2; print(a + b); }
```

The loop is expanded before the first time the body is called. There is no way to have any other kind of condition expression, that relies on the result of the body etc.

- init: must be an assignment statement for variable X.
- condition: Must be a bool expression with only variable X. Is executed before each time body is executed. 
- advance-statement: must be an assignement statement to X.
- body: this is required and must have brackets. Brackets can be empty, like "{}".


# WHILE

```
	while (my_array[a] != 3){
	}
```

- condition: executed each time before body is executed. If the condition is false initially, then zero loops will run.



# STRING

This is a pure 8-bit string type. It is immutable. You can compare with other strings, copy it using = and so on. There is a small kit of functions for changing and processing strings.

The encoding of the characters in the string is undefined. You can put 7-bit ASCII in them. Or UTF-8 etc. You can also use them as fast arrays of bytes.


##### ASSIGNMENT AND EQUALITY

- a = b
- a == b
- a <= b
- a != b


##### LOOKUP

This lets you access a random character in the string, using its integer position.

	a = "Hello"[1];
	assert(a == "e")


Notice 1: You cannot modify the string using [], only read. Use update() to change a character.
Notice 2: Floyd returns the character in a new string.



##### ADD / CONCATUNATING STRINGS

You can append to strings together using the + operation.

	a = "Hello" + ", world!"
	assert(a == "Hello, world!"



##### SIZE()

Returns the number of character elements in the string.
number_of_characters = a.size()

	assert(size("Hello") == 5)
	assert(size("") == 0)



##### FIND()

Finds first occurance, looking from start towards end of str.

	pos = find(str, substr)

pos = -1 if not found

	assert(find("hello, world", "he"] == 0)
	assert(find("hello, world", "e"] == 1)
	assert(find("hello, world", "x"] == -1)


##### SUBSET()

Extracts a range of characters from a string.
aka substr()

str2 = subset(str1, start_pos, end_pos)

start_pos: must be positive. It will be limited to the length of str1.
end_pos: must be positive. It will be limited to the length of str1.

	assert(subset("abc", 0, 3) == "abc");
	assert(subset("abc", 1, 3) == "bc");
	assert(subset("abc", 0, 0) == "");



##### STRING LITERALS

This is the strings contents you enter into the script code. They look like "Hello".
You cannot use any escape characters, like in the C-language.




# VECTOR

A vector is a collection of values where you lookup the values using an index between 0 and (vector size - 1). The positions in the vector are called "elements". The elements are ordered. Finding an element at a position uses constant time. In other languages vectors are called "arrays" or even "lists".

You can put ANY type of value into a vector: integers, floats, strings, structs, other vectors etc.

But all elements must be the same time.


##### ASSIGNMENT AND EQUALITY

- a = b
- a == b
- a <= b
- a != b


##### LOOKUP

This lets you access a random element in the vector, using its integer position.

	a = [10, 20, 30][1];
	assert(a == 20)


Notice: You cannot modify the vector using [], only read. Use update() to change an element.



##### ADD / CONCATUNATING VECTORS

You can append to vector together using the + operation.

	a = [ 10, 20, 30 ] + [ 40, 50 ];
	assert(a == [ 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ]);



##### SIZE()

Returns the number of elements in the vector.
number_of_elements = a.size()

	assert(size([ 10, 20, 30, 40 ]) == 4)
	assert(size([]) == 0)



##### FIND()

Finds first occurance, looking from start towards end of str.

	pos = find(str, substr)

pos = -1 if not found

	assert(find("hello, world", "he"] == 0)
	assert(find("hello, world", "e"] == 1)
	assert(find("hello, world", "x"] == -1)


##### SUBSET()

Extracts a range of characters from a string.
aka substr()

str2 = subset(str1, start_pos, end_pos)

start_pos: must be positive. It will be limited to the length of str1.
end_pos: must be positive. It will be limited to the length of str1.

	assert(subset("abc", 0, 3) == "abc");
	assert(subset("abc", 1, 3) == "bc");
	assert(subset("abc", 0, 0) == "");



##### VECTOR DEFINITIONS

You can make a new vector and specify its elements directly, like this:

	a = [ 1, 2, 3];		//	Creates a vector of ints with 3 elements.

You can also calculate elements:

	a = [ calc_pi(4), 2.1, calc_bounds() ];



##### UPDATE()

The vector is persistent so you *can* write elements to it, but you always get a *new* vector back - the original vector is unmodified. You use the update() function for this.

```
	a = ["one", "two", "three" ];
	b = update(a, 1, "zwei");
	assert(a == ["one", "two", "three" ] && b == ["one", "zeei", "three" ]);
```

##### FIND()

	assert(find([1,2,3], 4) == -1)
	assert(find([1,2,3], 1] == 0)
	assert(find([1,2,2,2,3], 2] == 1)



# STRUCTs - BASICS

Structs are the central building block for composing data in Floyd. They are used in place of structs and classes in other programming languages. Structs are always values and immutable. They are still fast and compact: behind the curtains copied structs  shares state between them, even when partially modified.

### Automatic features of every struct:

- constructor -- this is the only function that can create a value of the struct. It always requires every struct member, in the order they are listed in the struct definition. Make explicit function that makes making values more convenient.
- destructor -- will destroy the value including member values, when no longer needed. There are no custom destructors.
- Comparison operators: == != < > <= >= (this allows sorting too)
- Reading member values.
- Modify member values

There is no concept of pointers or references or shared structs so there are no problems with aliasing or side effects caused by several clients modifying the same struct.

This all makes simple structs extremely simple to create and use.

### Not possible:

- You cannot make constructors. There is only *one* way to initialize the members, via the constructor - which always takes *all* members
- There is no way to directly initialize a member when defining the struct.
- There is no way to have several different constructors, instead create explicit functions like make_square().
- If you want a default constructor, implement one yourself: ```rect make_zero_rect(){ return rect(0, 0); }```.
- There is no aliasing of structs -- changing a struct is always invisible to all other code that has copies of that struct.

```
	//	Make simple, ready-for use struct.
	struct rect {
		float width;
		float height;
	};


	//	Try the new struct:

	a = rect(0, 3);
	assert(a.width == 0);
	assert(a.height == 3);

	b = rect(0, 3);
	c = rect(1, 3);

	asset(a == a)
	asset(a == b)
	asset(a != c)
	asset(c > a)
```

A simple struct works almost like a collection with fixed number of named elements. It is only possible to make new instances by specifying every member or copying / modifying an existing one.

### Changing member variable of a struct:

```
	//	Make simple, ready-for use struct.
	struct rect {
		float width;
		float height;
	};

	a = rect(0, 3);

	//	Nothing happens! Setting width to 100 returns us a new rect but we we don't keep it.
	update(a,"width", 100)
	assert(a.width == 0)

	//	Modifying a member creates a new instance, we assign it to b
	b = update(a,"width", 100)

	//	Now we have the original, unmodified a and the new, updated b.
	assert(a.width == 0)
	assert(b.width == 100)
```

This works with nested values too:

```
	//	Define an image-struct that holds some stuff, including a pixel struct.
	struct image { string name; rect size; };

	a = image("Cat image.png", rect(512, 256));

	assert(a.size.width == 512);

	//	Update the width-member inside the image's size-member. The result is a brand new image, b!
	b = update(a, "size.width", 100);
	assert(a.size.width == 512);
	assert(b.size.width == 100);
```


### Struct runtime

Notice about optimizations, many accellerations are made behind the scenes:

- Causing a struct to be copied normally only bumps a reference counter and shares the data via a reference. This makes copy fast. This makes equality fast too -- the same objects is always equal.

- You cannot know that two structs with identical contents use the same storage -- if they are created independenlty from each other (not by copying) they are not necessarily deduplicated into the same object.
